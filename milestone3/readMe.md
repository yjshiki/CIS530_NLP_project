README for milestone3:
========
This baseline model is derived based on the 2015 paper Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. 
To run this on colab, first upload train.csv, val.csv, and test.csv files from local computer onto temporary google colab workspace. 
Run each module sequentially on colab file to download and install relevant files and output the training and validation accuracy and f1 scores. 

Performance on train and val set:
|data | accuracy% |  precision% | recall% | f1%
|train| 92.23 	 |  88.55	   | 87.74	 | 88.12  
|val  | 93.96	 |	93.04	   | 89.45	 | 91.04
|test | 93.92	 |  93.72		|90.60   | 92.00
