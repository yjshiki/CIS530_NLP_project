For your M2 deliverables, we’ll ask you to submit your data, plus a markdown file named data.md that describes the format of the data. If your data is very large, then you can submit a sample of the data and give a link to a Google Drive that contains the full data set. You data.md should describe the number of items in each of your training/dev/test splits.

It should give an example of the data, describe the file format of the data, give a link to the full data set (if you’re uploading a sample), and give a description of where you collected the data from.

# Format of data

The data given in https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140 contains 1.6 million tweets extracted using the twitter api. The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment. We preprocessed the data so that target, date and text are left.

It contains the following 6 fields:

1. target: the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 4 = positive) -> label: (0 = negative, 1 = positive)

2. ids: The id of the tweet ( 2087)

3. date: the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)

4. flag: The query (lyx). If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.

5. user: the user that tweeted (robotickilldozr)

6. text: the text of the tweet (Lyx is cool)
