# Format of data

The Twitter for Sentiment Analysis (T4SA) dataset http://www.t4sa.it/, was given in the paper "Cross-Media Learning for Image Sentiment Analysis in the Wild",  containing ~3.4M number of tweets. Each tweet has been labeled according to the sentiment polarity of the text (negative = 0, neutral = 1, positive = 2) predicted by tandem LSTM-SVM architecture, obtaining a labeled set of tweets in 3 categories. We merged t4sa_text_sentiment.tsv and raw_tweets_text.csv files based on the unique id, applied regex methods for text preprocessing and selected the class with the highest probability as our final label for the dataset (-1 = negative, 0 = neutral, 1 = positive), leaving only label and text columns in our dataset.

The original merged dataset contains the following 5 fields:

1. TWID: The id of the tweet (e.g. 768097627686604801)

2. text: the text of the tweet (e.g. osh Jenkins is looking forward to TAB Breeders Crown Super Sunday https://t.co/antImqAo4Y https://t.co/ejnA78Sks0)

3. NEG: the probability of the tweet falling in the negative class

4. NEU: the probability of the tweet falling in the neutral class

5. POS: the probability of the tweet falling in the positive class
